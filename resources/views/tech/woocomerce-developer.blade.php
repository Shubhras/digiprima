                <p class="sectionp2">Building an end-to-end custom Woocommerce implementation is a challenging and
                    exciting undertaking for any business leader. However, most are not utilizing the full potential of
                    the organization's resources. By deploying an innovation management solution like our Innovations
                    software, you can allow your team to aggregate all of your investment in resources, including
                    employees, customers and partners as well as academic research from startups and academia. We at
                    Woocommerce believe that our business needs to be more pro-active than reactive. A key factor in our
                    success is the ability to identify opportunities for new products and features, and then actually
                    move forward with those ideas. </p>
