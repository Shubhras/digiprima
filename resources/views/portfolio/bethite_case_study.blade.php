                    <h3>Our Technical Expertise</h3>
                    <p>Given the complexities of this domain, team DigiPrima addressed all the major concerns right from
                        the Project Inception stage.</p>

                    <p>BetHite is made on the Ethereum Blockchain utilizing the Smart Oracle Logic. Money betting is
                        done in the form of Ethers. BetHite uses smart oracle to automatically initiate the payments at
                        the appropriate times when bet is authenticated and results are verified bypassing manual
                        processes. Smart oracle encodes outcomes and conditions of the bet. It converts the contract
                        into code. Since the smart oracle is deterministic in nature, all conditions of the bet are
                        defined explicitly using configurable contract modules.</p>

                    <P>Thishelpsinsimplifyingandsecuringbets.Anyindividualorentitycannottamper with the smart oracle
                        logic at any stage of the betting process as the data in the blockchain is immutable and have a
                        complete decentralized advantage at all stage of the betting process. It also offers a fully
                        encrypted payment process to safeguard all financial details along with safeguarding all
                        personal information of its users. Post fulfillment of the condition of the bet, cryptocurrency
                        is automaticallytransferredtothewinnermakingtransactionsalmostinstantaneous.</P>
