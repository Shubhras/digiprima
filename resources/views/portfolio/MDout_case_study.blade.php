            <p>In today’s technological dependent world, no one can underestimate the importance of DATA. Data is at the
                forefront of everything. Unlike the past, most individuals are willing to share their personal details
                voluntarily via a multitude of social media platforms. </p>
            <br>
            <center>
                <img src="images/new2.png" alt="" />
            </center>

            <p>While this personal data is useful for all, no other industry needs it more then healthcare. Healthcare
                industry uses or need to use every data point, every historical information available for an individual
                to help them lead a healthy and long life.</p>
            <p>MDout at its core is a healthcare research and analytics company that leverages healthcare status,
                surveys, feedbacks and questionnaire systems to support better decision-making and patient satisfaction
                in a clinical setting. </p>
            <p>As a product, MDout focuses on empowering health organizations to be able to better track, manage and
                improve data (all within the confides of necessary and mandatory regulations and compliances).</p>
            <h3>A comprehensive product, MDout offers the following portals to all its end users:</h3>
            <ul class="new-sec-list">
                <li>Questionnaire Platform.</li>
                <li>Education Portal</li>
                <li>Communication portal. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>At Digiprimia, we were involved at every stage of the development of this project, right from the
                inception to its Live Deployment.</p>

            <p>Working on a project of this magnitude with evolving needs, we started our engagement right from the
                start. </p>
            <h3>Project Initiation</h3>
            <p>We started with first understanding USER NEEDS. Our assigned BA and PM conducted comprehensive online
                workshops to fully grasp the end user needs. During these workshops we did our own independent research,
                analyzed all available data and spoke with a select few end users. The information we gathered from
                these quantifiable entities enabled us to not only understand the overall needs of the project, but also
                the core needs and pain-points of the and users. At the conclusion of this exercise, we delivered:</p>
            <ul class="new-sec-list">
                <li>User Stories and Epics.</li>
                <li>Detailed Scope of Work.</li>
                <li>Resource Allocation Breakdown. </li>
                <li>Detailed Communication plan</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Development Planning</h3>
            <p>Keeping with Agile methodology, we started this undertaking by aligning 2 separate yet equally important
                teams to work in tanderm.</p>
            <p>The first team along with our UI/UX specialists started with working on visual representation of the
                project. Detailed and functioning wireframes were delivered to</p>
            <p>showcase our suggested layouts and application flow. Our focus was on delivering an innovative, user
                friendly and simple design layout.</p>
            <p>The second core development team along with our PM worked on finalizing the overall application
                architecture with focus on ensuring app is secure, stable and scalable. We looked at real world behavior
                to learn/analyses how existing services are used. We let data drive our decision making when it comes to
                preparing app architecture. </p>
            <h3>The core deliverables at this stage were:</h3>
            <ul class="new-sec-list">
                <li>Complete UI Designs with relevant data and user journey flow.</li>
                <li>Complete application technical architecture design and infrastructure details.</li>
                <li>Listing and management process of all 3rd Party Suppliers</li>
                <li>Comprehensive Project Plan with complete breakdown of functionalities covered under each milestone,
                    with detailed status reporting in real time.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3> Product Development and Testing</h3>
            <p>Every exercise, we conducted until this stage allowed us to prepare a comprehensive developmental road
                map which enabled us to be not only cost effective, but also extremely productive, agile and ensuring ON
                TIME deliveries.</p>
            <p>During this stage, the PM maintained various dashboards in real-time. We also provided daily, weekly and
                monthly Progress Report. A staging environment was maintained, where the client was able to see the
                progress as it happens. Requirement traceability matrix, forward and reverse traceability matrix were
                established and tracked to ensure scope, deliverables and product build is progressing in desirable
                direction.</p>
            <p><b>We conducted a complete review in-house before releasing any built. Our team of testers and QA Analyst
                    did a complete study and conducted a plethora of manual and automated testing on each deliverable
                    before releasing it for:</b></p>
            <ul class="new-sec-list">
                <li>Initial, stand alone UAT.</li>
                <li>Comprehensive UAT.</li>
                <li>Pre Application Deployment UAT.</li>
                <li>Post UAT feedback.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We also deployed comprehensive Risk Mitigation/Contingency Plan at this stage.</p>
            <h3> Communication Plan</h3>
            <p>In order ensure a complete synergy and flawless execution of the undertaking, we put a lot on emphasis on
                developing a complete, detailed and comprehensive “Communication Management Plan” during the initial
                planning phase of the project.<b> This plan helped us define the general communication requirements for
                    the project and included:</b></p>
            <ul class="new-sec-list">
                <li>The plan’s purpose and approach. </li>
                <li>Communication goals and objectives.</li>
                <li>Communication Roles.</li>
                <li>Communication Tools and Methods.</li>
                <li>High Level project communication messages.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3> Execution Plan</h3>
            <p>Understanding the elements of a project execution plan provided clarity to the role of the stakeholders
                and heleds in overcoming project challenges. For us, the Project Execution Plan (PEP) is the primary
                document that defines how the project will be undertaken. It details the specific activities in the
                project, the resources applied to the project, and the organization of the project. The core elements of
                a project execution<b> plan for this undertaking consisted of:</b></p>
            <ul class="new-sec-list">
                <li>Scope Definition: Scope definition entails defining what the project intends to achieve in specific
                    terms</li>
                <li>Statement of Goals: The statement of goals lists out specific project requirements such as key
                    project deliverables, milestones, and the project life cycle. The goal statement also helps explain
                </li>
                <li>Why the project is carried out, the purpose served by the project, and the expected benefits from
                    the project.</li>
                <li>The unique challenges that the project will overcome. </li>
                <li> The risks associated with the project and how the project plan will overcome such risks.</li>
                <li><b> Quality and Technical Specifications: </b>While the project scope and statement of goals make
                    clear the output of the project, one important element that needs inclusion in the project execution
                    plan is quality or technical specifications of the work processes and output. The achievement of
                    such stipulated standards determine the successful execution of the project. </li>
                <p><b>The parameters of quality and technical specification include the use of:</b></p>
                <li> Clear and precise definitions for concepts and terms.</li>
                <li>Measurable Descriptions.</li>
                <li> Attainable Standards.</li>
                <li>Time bound definitions.</li>
                <li><b> Allocation of Resources: </b>The elements of scope, goals, and quality define in clear terms
                    what the project hopes to achieve. The next element of a project execution plan that we take into
                    consideration is the allocation of resources to achieve the stated goals and quality standards.
                    Resources include staff with knowledge or skill sets, monetary constraints, and time consideration.
                </li>
                <li><b>Project Scheduling: </b>: Project scheduling by far is the most critical and important element in
                    a PEP. We utilize Gantt Charts that list what will happen and when. This allows us not not only
                    break the project into various deliverables, but also allows us resource allocation scheduling more
                    effectively. Attached Image #5 will help illustrate this better. </li>
            </ul>
