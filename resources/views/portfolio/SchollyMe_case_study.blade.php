            <p>SchollyMe is a mobile social platform for discovering talented athletes and also engages coaches,
                institutes and fans.</p>
            <p>Founder Melvin Nunnery’s big question:<b> How will an online platform engage athletes, coaches and
                    institutes?</b></p>
            <p>Team Digiprima took an unconventional approach while designing the iOS and Android applications of
                SchollyMe. Our challenge was to make it the best one-stop-shop for athletes’ admission and recruitment.
            </p>
            <p>We made the uploading of student athletes’ full game films, highlight reels, GPA scores, transcripts,
                SAT/ACT scores smooth apart from the functionality of receiving professional feedback. A unique feature
                that we added on client’s request was ‘Song of the day’ that would play on each user’s profile.</p>
            <h3>Testimony of our work</h3>
            <p>What a Great concept! Recruiting with a Social Media component to keep in touch with coaches, players and
                fans! – Scott Carper (User) </p>
            <p>This is a great app for all Student-Athletes to be recognized by potential College University's
                recruiting teams nationwide! </p>

            <h3>The Journey of SchollyMe</h3>

            <p>Founder Melvin Nunnery from California, USA had been a top athlete along with having a background of
                working in a music production company. So on a social network mobile app for athletes, he wanted to add
                <b>‘Song of the day’ </b>feature that would play automatically on user profiles till the user choose
                his/her own song to feature on the profile
            </p>
            <p>Team Digiprima accepted the challenge creating several unique features to echo well with young school
                athletes along with coaches, colleges and universities. We also successfully pulled off a completely
                secured system of uploading and viewing of students’ transcripts to be accessed only by the coaches.</p>
