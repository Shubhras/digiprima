            <h3>Market Opportunity </h3>
            <p>After much market research we found deficient coordination amongst Garage / Spare Part Suppliers /
                Customers which resulting in to buying expensive parts and unjustified additional time to get the repair
                fixed. Lack of integration and coordination is one of the dimness in Auto repair industry in UAE due to
                which all stake holders end up in spending more money and time. Let us not forget… time is also money.
            </p>
