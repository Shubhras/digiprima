            <h3>Market Opportunity </h3>
            <p>Billions of dollars are syndicated each month in equipment loans and leases. The current process is
                outdated and uneffetive. Buyers are sustained looking for new deals, while sellers face the challenges
                of finding homes for their loans or leases. Most transactions require a significant amount of
                documentation, credit underwriting and so forth between one or more parties. Spreadsheets, email and a
                limited Rolodex are the current way of conducting business. Finance Exchange is revolutionizing how
                buyers and sellers connect and transact business.
            </p>
