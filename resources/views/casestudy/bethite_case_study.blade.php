                compound annual growth rate.</p>

            <p>One would assume that online betting industry is very profitable however it is marred by money
                laundering, accusations of cheating and fraud. As financial incentives pour in online betting, the
                desire to cheat or hack increases.Users are questioning the authenticity and integrity of the online
                betting industry.</p>
            <h3>Market Opportunity for Blockchain Technology</h3>
            <p>Users are hesitant to risk their funds in a centralized non secure portal and the need of transparency
                and a decentralized tamper proof technology is rising in sports betting.</p>

            <p>Blockchain specifically targets the need of the hour and uses a decentralized system based on coordinated
                independent nodes network thereby not giving any particular a centralized advantage in the process.
                Blockchain is used to ensure randomness or rather incapability of knowing the outcome of a bet.</p>

                aims to boost the credibility of the gaming industry with its immutability.</p>

                    <h3>Our Technical Expertise</h3>
                    <p>Given the complexities of this domain, team DigiPrima addressed all the major concerns right from
                        the Project Inception stage.</p>

                    <p>BetHite is made on the Ethereum Blockchain utilizing the Smart Oracle Logic. Money betting is
                        done in the form of Ethers. BetHite uses smart oracle to automatically initiate the payments at
                        the appropriate times when bet is authenticated and results are verified bypassing manual
                        processes. Smart oracle encodes outcomes and conditions of the bet. It converts the contract
                        into code. Since the smart oracle is deterministic in nature, all conditions of the bet are
                        defined explicitly using configurable contract modules.</p>


                    <P>Thishelpsinsimplifyingandsecuringbets.Anyindividualorentitycannottamper with the smart oracle
                        logic at any stage of the betting process as the data in the blockchain is immutable and have a
                        complete decentralized advantage at all stage of the betting process. It also offers a fully
                        encrypted payment process to safeguard all financial details along with safeguarding all
                        personal information of its users. Post fulfillment of the condition of the bet, cryptocurrency
                        is automaticallytransferredtothewinnermakingtransactionsalmostinstantaneous.</P>


                    <P>BetHite allows users to access their profile and manage accounts, track games and securely
                        transfer funds. It is a flexible platform that allows managing odds of bet, tracking payouts and
                        bets. BetHite will change the gamut of peer to peer sports betting and enable transmission of
