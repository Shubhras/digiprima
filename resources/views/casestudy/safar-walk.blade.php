            <h3>Product Overview </h3>
            <p> A Safer Walk is a free <b>Safety Mobile App </b>dedicated to helping women connect with other local
                women safely, at any moment, to share: quick walks through suspicious parking lots, nights from school
                or work Walk home, share a cab or public transportation, or just get together for a jog, gym.
                <br><br>
                While there are endless GPS tracking and check-in apps available, these are responsive and often late in
                response. A safe walk is a proactive and preventive approach that discourages collisions and reduces
                attacks by empowering women with mobile technology that helps organize spontaneous pairs or groups when
                travelling by foot or shared rides.
