            <h3>Market Opportunity </h3>
            <p>We started with first understanding USER NEEDS. Our assigned BA and PM conducted comprehensive online
                workshops to fully grasp the end user needs. During these workshops we did our own independent
                research, analyzed all available data and spoke with a select few end users. The information we
                gathered from these quantifiable entities enabled us to not only understand the overall needs of the
                project, but also the core needs and pain-points of the and users. At the conclusion of this
                exercise, we delivered</p>

            <h3>Product Overview </h3>
            <p>We at Digiprima met this criterion. Thanks to our extensive experience and expertise in complex
                solutions for the financial and investment management domains. </p>
            <p>Keeping with Agile methodology, we started this undertaking by aligning 2 separate yet equally
                important teams to work in tanderm.The first team along with our UI/UX specialists started with
                working on visual representation of the project. Detailed and functioning wireframes were delivered
                to showcase our suggested layouts and application flow. Our focus was on delivering an innovative,
                user friendly and simple design layout.The second core development team along with our PM worked on
                finalizing the overall application architecture with focus on ensuring app is secure, stable and
                scalable. We looked at real world behavior to learn/analyses how existing services are used. We let
                data drive our decision making when it comes to preparing app architecture</p>
            <p>Every exercise, we conducted until this stage allowed us to prepare a comprehensive developmental
                road map which enabled us to be not only cost effective, but also extremely productive, agile and
                ensuring ON TIME deliveries.During this stage, the PM maintained various dashboards in real-time. We
                also provided daily, weekly and monthly Progress Report. A staging environment was maintained, where
                the client was able to see the progress as it happens. Requirement traceability matrix, forward and
                reverse traceability matrix were established and tracked to ensure scope, deliverables and product
                build is progressing in desirable direction.</p>
