            <h3>Business Challenge </h3>
            <p>ID care provides comprehensive solutions to its patients and specializes in treating infectious diseases. With a growing team of clinical experts and patients, they have faced quite a few challenges over time. DigiPrima focuses on providing Custom Healthcare Software Development solutions.  </p>

            <p>The HIPAA act is in itself a challenge. Additionally, there is a need to create user accounts for the management, patients and doctors. It is quite impossible to manually keep track of all patients, medicines and experts. Thus, there is a need to Build HIPAA Compliant Software. 
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, ID care decided to build a hospital management software that can help keep track of patient records, medicines, inventory status, physicians, generate reports as per HIPAA guidelines, etc. They needed cost-effective software, a simple user interface, and extra tools to help manage the overall organization. 
            </p>

            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p>With the need to comply with HIPAA guidelines and resolve the challenges immediately, Digiprima took up the HIPAA Compliant Software Development process.
 
             The CRM HIPAA Compliant software has certain features which make it easy to create, modify and handle multiple accounts simultaneously. It includes login facilities not just for the admin but for the staff and physicians as well.
