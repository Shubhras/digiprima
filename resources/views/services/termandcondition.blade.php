            <p style="color:#606060 ; text-transform:lowercase;">3.1 Services. <b>Digiprima</b> provides "Services" to
                its Customers. For the purpose of the Agreement, "Services" is defined as the software services provided
                by Digiprima to the Customer and as fully described under an applicable "Order" (as defined under
                Section 3.3). Subject to Digiprima's receipt of the applicable Fees (as detailed under an Order) from
                the Customer, Digiprima will use commercially reasonable efforts to make the Services available to
                Customer, in compliance with the terms of this Agreement and an applicable Order.<br><br>
                3.2 License to Digiprima Services. Digiprima hereby grants the Customer, for the Term (as defined under
                Section 8.1), a limited, non-exclusive, non-sub-licensable, non-transferable, non-assignable right to
                access and use the Services. Any such use of the Services by Customer is authorized solely for
                Customer's internal business and is subject to Customer's compliance with any additional limitations and
                restrictions as may be specified under an applicable Order.<br><br>
                3.3 On-premises Deployment. If under an applicable Order, Customer is accessing Digiprima services
                through an on-premises deployment through a docker container or otherwise, the right to access such
                service shall only be limited to the time period mentioned in the applicable Order. In absence of any
                agreement to the contrary in the applicable Order, right to use the Services through such deployment
                shall also be limited, non-exclusive, non-sub-licensable, non-transferable, non-assignable. Upon the
                lapse of the applicable Service duration, Customer shall destroy and permanently delete all Digiprima
                data from their premises, and send appropriate proof of such destruction to Digiprima. Until one (1)
                year after the lapse of the applicable Service duration, Digiprima shall have the ongoing right to
                inspect, and audit customer's servers for Digiprima usage data and proof of any violation of such
                limited license. The consumption of any additional licenses without prior payment shall be a considered
                a material breach of this Agreement, which shall be remediable only by pro-rata payment being made to
                Digiprima. In case a Digiprima Partner or Reseller has made an on-premises deployment to its customer
                ("End Customer"), such Partner shall ensure that it has rights of the same nature in written with regard
                to the servers of End Customer.<br><br>
                3.4 Order. For the purposes of this Agreement, an "Order" is defined as an order form or other similar
                document (including but not limited to an online order form) that details the Services being provided
                hereunder and the applicable Fees to be paid by the Customer to Digiprima. The Order may also provide
                details regarding the service level terms (if any). In the event of a conflict between the Order and the
                Terms of Service, the Order will prevail.<br><br>
                3.5 Trials. If Customer is accessing or making use of the Service on a trial basis or on an evaluation
                basis as identified in the corresponding Order (the "Trial"), Customer may use the Services during the

                CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THE TRIAL IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS AND THE TRIAL IS
                PROVIDED WITHOUT ANY INDEMNIFICATION, SUPPORT, OR WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATION OF ANY KIND. Further,

                specified in the corresponding Order. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING CONTAINED HEREIN, FOR PURPOSES OF A
                TRIAL, THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS-IS" WITHOUT ANY REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND/OR
                INDEMNITIES.<br><br>
                3.6 No-fee Access. If Customer is accessing or making use of the Service on a no-fee basis (the "Limited
                Use"), Customer may use the Services during the Limited Use provided such use does not exceed the
                Service levels specified on the Digiprima website with respect to Limited Use. Customer acknowledges and
                agrees that the Limited Use is provided on an "as-is" basis, and the Limited Use is provided without any
                indemnification, support, or warranties or representation of any kind. Additionally, Customer
                acknowledges and agrees that Digiprima may terminate the Limited Use at any time and for any reason or

                similar proceeding;<br><br> (c) following thirty (30) days written notice if Customer is in breach of
                this Agreement or any Order (and has not cured such breach, if curable, within the thirty (30) days of
                such notice); or<br><br> (d) Customer has failed to pay Digiprima the Fees with respect to the Services.

                the Indemnified Party allows the indemnifying party to assume full control of the defense of the claim,
                including retaining counsel of its own choosing. Upon the assumption by the indemnifying party of the
                defense of a claim with counsel of its choosing, the indemnifying party will not be liable for the fees
                and expenses of additional counsel retained by any Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall
                cooperate with the indemnifying party in the defense of any such claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing

                Indemnified Party voluntarily, and without the indemnifying party's prior written consent, to settle a
                claim. Subject to the maximum liability set forth in Section 12, the provisions of this Section 10
                constitute the entire understanding of the parties regarding each party's respective liability under
                this Section 10, including but not limited to Infringement Claims (including related claims for breach
                of warranty) and each party's sole obligation to indemnify and reimburse any Indemnified Party.</p><br>

                communications, and other understandings relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, and all
                waivers and modifications must be in a writing signed by both parties, except as otherwise provided
